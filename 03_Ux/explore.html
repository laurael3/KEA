            <h2>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</h2>
            <h3>Directed by Terry Gilliam (1998) Adventure Comedy Drama</h3>
            <p>
              In "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," the use of color is integral
              to capturing the hallucinogenic and chaotic experiences of its
              characters. The film has a very weird storyline, and paying
              attention to the colours throughout makes the film a lot easier to
              understand. The film employs a wild and surreal color palette
              filled with vivid and disorienting hues, mirroring the
              drug-induced journeys of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo. This
              unconventional use of color immerses viewers in the mind-altering
              and chaotic world of the protagonists, enhancing the film's
              portrayal of their drug-fueled escapades and adding to its unique
              and disorienting visual style.

            <h2>Blade Runner: 2049</h2>
            <h3>Directed by Denis Villeneuve (2017) Action Drama Mystery</h3>
            <p>
              In "Blade Runner 2049," color is special because it plays a
              central role in creating a visually stunning and immersive future
              world. The film's muted and desaturated palette contrasts with
              vibrant neon lights, making every frame a striking visual
              composition. This use of color enhances the movie's dystopian
              atmosphere, making it feel both familiar and alien, and
              contributes to the film's unique and captivating cinematic
              experience.
