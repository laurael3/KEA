            In "Mad Max: Fury Road," color functions as a potent form of visual
            storytelling, conveying the brutality of the world and the stark
            juxtaposition between oppressive rule and the fight for freedom. The
            film's dynamic action sequences are expertly choreographed to
            amplify the impact of color, creating a visually captivating
            cinematic experience that immerses viewers in the vividly realized
            post-apocalyptic universe while enhancing the storytelling by
            highlighting the harshness of the dystopian landscape.

            In "Edward Scissorhands," director Tim Burton uses color to convey
            the stark contrast between the protagonist, and the suburban
            community he enters. The protaonist lives in a pale, almost ghostly
            world, symbolizing his isolation and otherness. In contrast, the
            colorful, cookie-cutter houses and residents of the neighborhood
            stand out in vivid pastels, emphasizing their conformity and
            superficiality. This visual opposite of the monochrome world and the
            vibrant, yet artificial, surroundings highlights the film's themes
            of the struggle to belong in a conformist society.

            In "Joker," color is used to show the transformation of Arthur into
            the Joker character. The film's early scenes are in muted colors,
            reflecting Arthur's bleak and downtrodden life. As his Joker persona
            progress, the color palette becomes more vibrant, signifying his
            liberation and madness. This deliberate shift in color shows his
            transformation from a marginalized, mentally ill individual who
            through a societal breakdown becomes a symbol of chaos and rebellion
            with the embrace of his Joker persona.
